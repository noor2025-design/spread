What we did/learned for this project:
- animation/keyframes
- flex
- media queries (including print)
- variables
- text-shadows
- asides/sup
- negative margin ::before/::after (for blockquotes)
- dark mode
- prefers-reduce-motion
- calc(var)


What we could've done with more time:
- have more interaction/dynamics at play in the body copy (maybe pick out key words and visually show the references on hover)
- play around more with the font and color
- figure out more dynamic blockquotes
- make it more accessible with screenreaders, color, etc. (aria-label wasn't working with VO when we tried)
